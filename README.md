# github-workflows

Reusable CI/PR/AI workflows for TokenLogic repositories, called by short
caller files copied into each repo (see `callers/delivering-repo/`). This
repo is private: `ai-comment.yml` and `proposal-checks.yml` fetch their
scripts through `.github/actions/scripts@main`, so they always follow
`main` — GitHub fetches that composite action itself, the same mechanism
`coverage-gate` uses, so no token is needed. The org's Actions access
setting on this repo must allow org repositories.

## Reusable workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Key inputs | Secrets |
|---|---|---|---|
| `foundry-ci.yml` | `forge fmt`/`build`/`test`/`sizes`/gas report + optional coverage gate | `min_coverage` (0-100, default 0=off) | `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, `QUICKNODE_TOKEN`, `QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_NAME` |
| `pr-board.yml` | Syncs a PR/issue to the project board (`command: pr-issue-check` or `pr-sync`) | `command`, `board_app_ref`, `dry_run` | `BOARD_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| `ai-comment.yml` | Posts an advisory AI comment: a PR review (`kind: review`, only on an `ai-review` label add) or an issue scope check (`kind: scope`, on issue open) | `kind`, `backend` (`anthropic`/`openrouter`), `dry_run`, `board_app_ref`, `discord_bot_ref`, `config` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `BOARD_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` |
| `report-comment.yml` | Posts a CI result comment on the triggering PR, `workflow_run`-based | `workflow-name`, `dry_run` | none |
| `proposal-checks.yml` | Governance-proposal gate: address-book + spelling + coverage (blocking), forum-vs-diff spec check + decimals sanity (advisory). One proposal folder per PR: a PR touching zero `src/<dir>/` folders skips every check (green); a PR touching more than one fails fast. | `min_coverage`, `backend`, `dry_run` | `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, `QUICKNODE_TOKEN`, `QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_NAME`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `review-ping.yml` | Notifies a configured bot repo when a review is requested | `discord_bot_ref`, `dry_run` | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` |
| `quality-scan.yml` | Batch scope-checks every open board issue (skipping ones already commented), posts a scope comment per issue, then runs the bot's batch quality check | `statuses`, `max_issues`, `board_app_ref`, `discord_bot_ref`, `backend`, `dry_run` | `BOARD_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` |
| `required-ci.yml` / `required-proposals.yml` | Org-ruleset entry points; wrap `foundry-ci.yml` / `proposal-checks.yml` with no per-repo inputs | — | forwarded from the ruleset repo |

`pr-board.yml`, `ai-comment.yml` (kind: scope), `quality-scan.yml`, and
`review-ping.yml` check out the board app and/or bot repos by name; those
names are never hard-coded here. They come from the org-level repository
variables `TRACKER_REPO`, `BOARD_APP_REPO`, and `BOT_REPO`, which must be set
on any org that uses these workflows -- each workflow fails closed with a
clear error if the variable it needs is empty.

`ai-comment.yml`'s `kind: review` path only runs when the `ai-review` label
is added to a PR (not on open/synchronize); it removes the label after
posting, so re-adding it re-triggers the review. The `kind: scope` path
keeps its 24h recency gate and its own AI comment via `render_ai_comment.py`
(built from the model's strict-JSON output, never raw model text), plus a
single-issue bot quality check right after posting.

`dry_run` defaults to `true` everywhere; flip to `false` only for an approved
live window.

## Reusable action: `coverage-gate`

Runs `forge coverage`, sums line coverage under `path_prefix` (excluding
`exclude_suffixes`), and fails if it's below `min_coverage`. Shared by
`foundry-ci.yml` (all of `src/`) and `proposal-checks.yml` (payload files
only).

## Minimal caller example

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      actions: read
    uses: "halnation/github-workflows/.github/workflows/foundry-ci.yml@<github-workflows commit SHA>"
    with:
      min_coverage: 80
    secrets:
      ALCHEMY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ALCHEMY_API_KEY }}
      QUICKNODE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.QUICKNODE_TOKEN }}
      QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_NAME: ${{ secrets.QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_NAME }}
```

More examples, including `ai.yml`, `board.yml`, and `report.yml`, live under
`callers/delivering-repo/`. `callers/tracker-quality-scan.yml` is a
`workflow_dispatch` caller for `quality-scan.yml` on the tracker board repo.
Replace every `@<github-workflows commit SHA>` placeholder with the reviewed
commit SHA before use.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
```

Workflow YAML is validated with `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(f))"`
over every file. Run `dev/run-proposal-checks-locally.sh` to exercise the
`proposal-checks.yml` advisory step (spec-check + decimals scale check)
against a local proposal repo without a GitHub Actions round-trip.
