"""Deterministic extraction of payload-side actions from a
ProtocolV3TestBase-generated diff report (diffs/*.md). No AI involved --
the diff report is the ground truth for what the payload actually executes.

Best-effort: this parser targets the common "decoded value" shape the diff
report emits for ERC20 transfer/approval-style state changes, e.g. a line
containing a human amount, a bracketed [raw, N decimals] pair, and a 0x
address. When the diff report is empty or unparseable (for example, if the
fork test could not complete -- a real live-mainnet-state failure unrelated
to any payload bug), this returns an empty list and the caller must say so
plainly rather than inventing payload data.
